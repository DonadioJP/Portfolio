While this practice is common, it contrasts with natural social dynamics and raises welfare concerns. Social isolation can lead to stress, fearfulness, and reduced cognitive development. Group housing (pairs or small groups) has emerged as a potential alternative, but its effects on performance, health, and behavior remain inconsistently reported across studies.")
